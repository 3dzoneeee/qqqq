          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        </center>

        <p>
          <br>Edson Jay A. Malazar is my name. I'm a resident of Bliss Village in City of Ilagan Isabela. April 29, 2002 is the day I was born. I'm 20 years old right now. Both my mother and father are from the Camarines Sur province. Both of them
          resided in the Bicol region, but we are currently in Isabela. Although we don't have any relatives here, we are quite good at interacting with others. Bicol language is the mother tongue of our parents. We can now understand languages like
          Ilocano and Ibanag because we reside here. Although we can understand those languages, speaking them is really challenging for us. I am the second of three siblings to be born. My youngest brother is 12 years old, and my older brother is 24
          years old.
        <p>
          <br />
          I chose BSIT as my college major because I adore computers and consider them to be my passion. I get along well with my classmates and teachers since I have a typically outgoing disposition. In class, I pay attention and offer assistance.
          When I was in junior high school, I did exceptionally well in my Technical Vocational Livelihood (TVL) class at Isabela School of Arts and Trades (ISAT)speciality subject, Computer System Servicing (CSS). However, I am currently enrolled at
          Isabela State University where I am occupied with the mid-year prerequisite subjects for my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree.. It's incredibly challenging to study programming and comprehend everything about computers.
          However, I am aware that I never anticipated how challenging preparing for this course and working toward my objectives would be. Even though learning programming and everything about computers is extremely challenging, I am confident that
          I
          can complete this course and one day succeed. <br>
        <p>I am an approachable, easy to get along with person who values kindness, respect, motivation, confidence, and self-discipline. I can also be a little bit lucky at times. I have a lot of friends I can trust. We often have fun together, and
          when we do run into an issue, we always figure it out together. When I'm with them, I sometimes go wild and crazy. Every time they see me, my friends comment on how cheerful I always seem to be. I always grin since it's one of my best
          qualities. Their happy pill is me. When projects take longer than expected, I become frustrated while studying. One of my faults is that I might be unconfident at times.<br>
          <br>
        <p>When I have free time in the afternoon, my friends and I like to play basketball. playing online games like Call of Duty, Mobile Legends, etc. Every Thursday and Sunday, I enjoy going to church to pray and give thanks to the Lord for all
          the
          blessings he bestows upon our family. I enjoy reading manga and manhua as well as watching anime. Because of the storyline and Luffy's adventures as the main character, One Piece is my favorite anime. Black is my favorite color, and I adore
          sporting black t-shirts. I enjoy reading a few books as well. I especially enjoy learning about math, science, English, and Filipino.<br>
          <br>
        <p>I am committed to pursuing my goals, no matter how challenging they may be. Making my parents pleased and achieving financial stability are two of my goals. I wish my parents could witness my future success. I constantly ask God to grant
          our
          family a strong and healthy body. Everything happens for a reason is my life's motto. Always be optimistic and keep your dreams in mind. Whatever happens, I can always rely on my family and friends. And I give God praise for bringing them
          into my life.<br>

          Edson is the kind of person who does more and speaks less. He rarely talks about his plans because he knows that people will respect him more if they heard the results of his hard work first, more than that he's trying to level up every
          single day. I can see in him the work ethic of my grandparents and the discipline of today's generation combined which are the ingredients of success in every circumstance he face.

          I knew him since we were in grade six. He is been always a jolly and cheerful person. He always makes other people laugh and be friendly to everyone. The type of person who enjoyed his life and just chill in terms of his high school life.
          He treasures his friends and he is truly an important person to me because he showed me how to handle things lightly and he motivated me. Although I know he experienced difficulties in life but he always put a smile on his face. He is truly
          a strong person who loves to play mobile legends. A person who can truly trust and who is always open to listen to my problems and rants in life. I am looking forward to seeing him succeed in life in the future

          His ambition and dreams are big for himself and his family. He learned responsibility and kindness from his mother and father. Having his family is a good reason to keep fighting for his dreams, and their love is his support system for
          pursuing his life's greatest ambitions. He is an amazing person. I've known him for about 3 years. He is cute and caring. Being around him was a lot of fun. He is always there for you when you need him, and he never leaves you, even when
          you are going through a difficult moment. I adore him so much because of this.

          <p> I've gone to a lot of places, but this is one of my favorites. It's in Isabela's Ilagan City. I last came here in 2019, before the Covid virus broke out. As part of one of our course requirements in grade 12, my classmates and I vlog
            here. Here, we have a lot of fun. I've never had a better experience than this one.<br>
            <br>
            <img class="img-moon" src="img/moon.jpg" alt="moon" />
            This place is known as the “Boracay of the North”. . Great views of the azure ocean and excellent beaches are present. There are numerous homestays and a sizable resort that can accommodate guests for a night or possibly several days.
            Last month, I took a trip here with some pals to unwind and have some fun. It is among Pagudpud's top locations.<br>
            <br>
            <img class="img-bato1" src="img/bato1.jpg" alt="bato1" /> <img class="img-bato2" src="img/bato2.jpg" alt="bato2" />

            These places are located in Ilagan Isabela. We regularly visit this location anytime we want to have some fun. The Abuan River is seen in the first image, while the Bintacan River is shown in the second. In Ilagan, people frequently go
            there. Every weekend, a large number of people come here to swim and enjoy fun with their loved ones.<br>
            <br>
            <img class="img-anime" src="img/anime.jpg" alt="anime" />
            Us One Piece fans will never stop raving about the truly great soundtrack that continually supports the anime's scenes, in addition to the plot and the characters, and for good cause. Easily one of the best anime soundtracks is found in
            One Piece. Each song in this series appears to be trying to outdo the last, and the result is a simply great experience. The series is elevated to a higher level thanks to this fantastic soundtrack, which consistently gives the already
            fantastic moments a deeper emotional undertone. <br>

            A domesticated animal kept as a pet is one that coexists with humans but is often not fed or made to work. My cat's name is Nuggets, and my dog's name is Mimi. I treat them like a person. I love playing with them to relieved some stress.
            <img class="img-bball" src="img/bball.jpg" alt="bball" />
            PLaying basketball is one of my sports.I love playing basketballwith my friends and neighbors every afternoon. I meet more people everytime i play in other baranggay.
